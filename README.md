**Cybersecurity Student | Entry-Level Ethical Hacking & SOC-Oriented**

I am a cybersecurity-focused student with a clear interest in **Ethical Hacking** and **SOC operations** at an entry level.
My current goal is to build a solid technical foundation through hands-on labs, security practice environments, and small automation scripts, while developing the mindset required for real-world security analysis.

---

## Core Interests

* Ethical Hacking (fundamentals, lab-based practice)
* SOC fundamentals & security monitoring concepts
* Security learning through hands-on labs and CTF-style challenges

---

## Technical Skills

**Programming & Scripting**

* Python (basic scripting, small automation tasks)
* C++ (fundamentals, academic problem-solving)

**Cybersecurity Fundamentals**

* Basic reconnaissance concepts (enumeration mindset, attack surface awareness)
* Understanding of common web vulnerabilities at a conceptual level
* Entry-level SOC concepts: alerts, logs, incident awareness

**Systems & Environment**

* Linux and Windows basic usage for security labs
* Basic understanding of networking concepts (IP, ports, services)
* MySQL (basic queries and usage in learning projects)

---

## Learning & Practice

* Practice through isolated labs and CTF-style environments
* Writing technical notes and basic security reports for self-study
* Focus on understanding **how attacks and defenses work**, not just tool execution

---

## GitHub Overview

* Learning-oriented repositories (scripts, lab notes, experiments)
* Code written for clarity and understanding rather than production use
